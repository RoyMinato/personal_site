                <p>I am a recent college graduate from UC Irvine currently searching for a job in a software engineering role. I would say my interest in programming is the result of growing up being interested in computer related technologies and the opportunity to solve challenging problems. Before I had decided to study data science, I was always interested and proficient in physics throughout high school and some college courses. However, I'm very happy with the choice I made to pursue a computer science related field since that knowledge can be applied to work with many different fields.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I consider myself to be somebody who is capable of adapting to different situations and as a person who remains positive despite whatever may be happening around me. I like to think of myself as somebody who is rational and kind to others and as somebody who can adapt in group situations so my peers can have a good experience and enjoy working with me. In my free time, I enjoy playing games with friends, spending time with family, and going to the gym.</p>

                <h5 class="titles">Education &#127891;</h5>
                <p>My college education started at Irvine Valley College where I was first exposed to programming. I decided to take the introductory computer science courses as I was interested in computers since I was a child and spent a lot of time playing games like RuneScape. I had really great professors who continually sparked my growing interest in programming and challenged me to always strive to improve my knowledge and abilities. While at IVC, I also joined the Model United Nations club.</p>
                <br>
                <p>After two years at IVC, I transferred to UC Irvine and chose to be in the Data Science program as I was also very interested in statistics. I enjoyed the data science courses and capstone project at UCI as they allowed me to experiment with programming through a statistical lens. I graduated with a B.S. in Data Science from UCI in June 2022. Shortly after graduating, I wanted to learn something new and so I began learning web development through <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/" target="_blank">The Odin Project</a>, which is how I learned to create this webpage!</p>

                <p>The code for all projects below are available on my <a href="https://github.com/RoyMinato" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
                <ul class="projList">
                    <li><a href="https://royminato.github.io/odin-recipes/" target="_blank">Recipe website</a>: My first web dev project, very basic and minimal CSS use.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://royminato.github.io/landing-page/" target="_blank">Landing page</a>: A project with much more CSS use, specifically using flexbox to handle positioning and alignment.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://royminato.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/" target="_blank">Rock paper scissors</a>: Introducing basic JavaScript to allow the user to interact with the page.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://github.com/shoushimayaUCI/ElectionPredictions" target="_blank">U.S. Election predictions</a>: UC Irvine senior data science capstone project. While I do not appear as a contributor on the repo, my name is on the final report pdf in the repo. My responsibilties in the project were based around data engineering datasets from multiple sources using Python and libraries such as Pandas and NumPy to create a single comprehensive dataset of information regarding political elections in the U.S. by county.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://royminato.github.io/etch-a-sketch/" target="_blank">Etch-a-Sketch</a>: A small project using JavaScript to allow users to draw with different colors and grid dimensions.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://royminato.github.io/suduko/" target="_blank">Suduko</a>: This is a naive board generator meaning that cells are positioned randomly but still respect sudoku rules each time the page is refreshed. However, because of the randomness, it is not able to be solved without guessing unlike a regular board. It was still interesting to try and accomplish.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://royminato.github.io/calculator/" target="_blank">Calculator</a>: A basic calculator app similar to the kinds of calculators built-in on most phones and computers.</li>
                    <li>This webpage! Made by me to add a greater experience in getting to know me and my skills that is not appropriate for a standard resume.</li>
